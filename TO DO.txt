Add favor towards UE/Enemy

Add bribing factions to not attack their current target(?)

Add alliances with factions

Type checking (-_-  )

Factions have location array of locations not hidden to them

Replace all .get(0)s used to get player faction

Classes in seperate files

======== Ideas ========
Faction class
	name
	enemy
	advantages(?)
		resource boost
		damage boost
		health boost
	favor (0-100, 50=neutral, 100=UE, 0=Enemy, start 25-75)

Gaining favor
	Trade routes (increases favor over time)
	Attacking a factions target faction
Losing favor
	Attacking the faction



======= Premise =======
Manage resources
Ally with factions to get them to join UE
	Once a faction joins UE all of their resources and locations become yours
Fight main enemy/other factions
	Taking over a location through military force makes only that location UE

Main enemy will also try to ally with other factions

Secondary factions (not player or main enemy) will fight each other as well to keep map changing

All factions gain resources each turns

Mines -> metal
Fighter base + metal -> ships
Colonized planets -> credits
Research stations + credits -> tech
