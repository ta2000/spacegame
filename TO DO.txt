======== TO DO ========
Attacking
	output damage done/hp left on UE locations
	Only alert attacks near player locations?
	Fix error after one faction conquers all locations
		IS ALERTING THE PLAYER OF AI ATTACKS EVEN NECESSARY? SHOULD REMOVE IN FINAL GAME

Garrison ships on targetted locations to increase hp
	
Repairing damaged locations with credits (+metal +tech?)

Trade resources method

Add giving tech

Type checking (-_-  )

Factions have location array of locations not hidden to them

Classes in seperate files

(do after necessary stuff for easy multiplayer port)
	Add favor towards UE/Enemy 

	Add bribing factions to not attack their current target

	Add alliances with factions

	Increasing difficulty with number of UE locations

======== Ideas ========
Faction class
	name
	enemy
	advantages(?)
		resource boost
		damage boost
		health boost
	favor (0-100, 50=neutral, 100=UE, 0=Enemy, start 25-75)

Gaining favor
	Giving tech
	Attacking a factions target faction
Losing favor
	Attacking the faction



======= Premise =======
Manage resources
Ally with factions to get them to join UE
	Once a faction joins UE all of their resources and locations become yours
Fight main enemy/other factions
	Taking over a location through military force makes only that location UE

Main enemy will also try to ally with other factions

Secondary factions (not player or main enemy) will fight each other as well to keep map changing

All factions gain resources each turns

Fighter base + metal -> ships
Mines -> metal
Colonized planets -> credits
Research stations + credits -> tech
Nations + tech -> favor

androids -> Enemy mine

maxis -> Enemy FB
