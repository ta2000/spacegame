======== TO DO ========
Trade routes
	Ship visible on map? (=)
	AI creates trade routes
		Trades highest amount for lowest amount
	Fix error when no factions have right trade
	Fix issue with player trading with wrong faction

Remove switch statements for resource names, include n,n,n in resources.txt for resources arr index, amount to remove from other index, and index to remove from
	This makes infinite resource adding to file, no changing code
Also add name of produced resource
	name,resource,min,max,hp,resourceIndex,cost,removalIndex 
	mine,metal,100,230,1000,0(metal),0,0
	fighter base,ships,15,25,500,1(ships),10(costs 10),1(metal)

More resources?
	Factories -> consumer goods*
	colonized planets + consumer goods -> credits

Attacking
	Only alert attacks near player locations?
	Fix error after one faction conquers all locations
	
Garrison ships on targetted locations to increase hp
	
Repairing damaged locations with credits (+metal +tech?)
	Auto repair sorts locations based on hp and repairs in order from lowest to highest health

Expiring attack logs?

Sleep in between attack outputs?

Fleets take time to get to destination
	Visible on map?

Write game log to file?
	Attack outputs
	Resource gains for each faction
	Trade route creations

Add favor towards UE/Enemy

Add bribing factions to not attack their current target(?)

Add alliances with factions

Type checking (-_-  )

Factions have location array of locations not hidden to them

Replace all .get(0)s used to get player faction

Classes in seperate files

======== Ideas ========
Faction class
	name
	enemy
	advantages(?)
		resource boost
		damage boost
		health boost
	favor (0-100, 50=neutral, 100=UE, 0=Enemy, start 25-75)

Gaining favor
	Trade routes (increases favor over time)
	Attacking a factions target faction
Losing favor
	Attacking the faction



======= Premise =======
Manage resources
Ally with factions to get them to join UE
	Once a faction joins UE all of their resources and locations become yours
Fight main enemy/other factions
	Taking over a location through military force makes only that location UE

Main enemy will also try to ally with other factions

Secondary factions (not player or main enemy) will fight each other as well to keep map changing

All factions gain resources each turns

Mines -> metal
Fighter base + metal -> ships
Colonized planets -> credits
Research stations + credits -> tech
